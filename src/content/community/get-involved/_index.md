    Choose a dataset from the list of Datasets and start gathering data from it. You can then provide any kind of feedback on the dataset: reports about any malfunctions, suggestions for improvements or new features, and so on.​ Moreover, if you are interested in datasets that are not yet in our collection, get in touch with the Open Data Hub team to discuss your request.​
    ​…browse our collection of pre-built Web Components​
    Enhance your website or app with ease: browse the list of available Web Components, choose one that you are interested in, try it out, then send feedback to their developers if you feel something is wrong or missing.​"

    Browse the list of Datasets to see what types of data are contained in the datasets, and think how they can be used.​ For this purpose, we maintain an updated list of available Datasets with links to the API to access them.​

    …build an application with the data.​
    Write code for an app that combines the data you can harvest from the available datasets in various, novel way.​
    To reach this goal, you need to access the APIs, their documentation, and the datasets. It is then your task to discover how you can reuse the data in your code.​

​       …integrate Open Data Hub data using Web Components.​
    The Open Data Hub team and their partner have developed a library of Web Components that can be integrated in existing websites or used as guidance to develop new Web Components.​

    ​…publish my app in Open Data Hub.​
    As soon as you have developed a stable version of your app, get in touch with us: We plan to maintain an updated list of apps based on our dataset.​

    ​No software installation is needed. Develop in a language of your choice an application that uses our data."

    description: "…help shape the future of Open Data Hub.​
    Participate in the development of Open Data Hub: Build new data collectors, extend the functionality of the broker, integrate new datasets on the existing infrastructure, develop new stable API versions.​

    To be able to become a core hacker, however, requires a few additional tasks to be carried out:
    1. ​Learn how to successfully integrate your code with the existing code-base and how to interact with the Open Data Hub team. In other words, you need to check the Developer’s Flight Rules​

    2. Understand the Open Data Hub _Architecture.​ _ >>>>>> [TBC!!]

    3. Install the necessary software on your local workstation (be it a physical workstation, a virtual machine, or a Docker instance), including PostgreSQL with postgis extension, JDK, git.​

    4. Set up all the services needed (database, application server, and so on).​

    5. Clone our git repositories. To successfully complete these tasks, please read the How to set up your local Development Environment? >>>>>>[TBC!!] tutorial, which guides you stepwise through all the required set up and configuration, along with some troubleshooting advice.​

    6. Coding. That’s the funniest part, enjoy!​"
