  title: "Open Data Hub Customer Care AI Chatbot"
  subtitle: " LLMs have the potential to transform the workplace by taking over language processing tasks previously performed by humans. This is particularly true in areas such as customer service and software development. To explore the possibilities of LLMs, the Open Data Hub team set out to create a proof of concept chatbot. Drawing on an extensive pool of project data, such as code on GitHub, documentation and the project website, this chatbot helps the Open Data Hub's customer support team to assist their customers. Chris Mair will discuss the technologies used, the challenges faced and the results of this first PoC."
